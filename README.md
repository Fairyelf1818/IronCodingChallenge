OLD PHONE KEYPAD DECODER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a C# console app that simulates typing on an old mobile phone keypad.

How it works
- Press number keys from 2-9 to type letters. I mean 1 has &'( which wasn't included in the instructions
  For example: "2" = A, "22" = B, "222" = C, and so on.
- Pause for 1 second between taps to switch letters when using the same key.
- Use "*" to backspace.
- Use "#" to finish input and decode the message.

Example
  Input: 4433555 555666#
  Output: HELLO

To run:
- Open in Visual Studio or run with `dotnet run`
- Target .NET 7 or compatible
- Follow on-screen instructions

Tests:
Basic unit tests run after input to verify functionality.

PSA - Thank you guys for giving me the chance to demonstrate my skills. I promise if I'm given the opportunity (even probationary lol) I won't disappoint you.
